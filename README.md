## Before Proceeding
Ensure you have all the required libraries installed to run the YOLOv8 model and visualize the results. This includes ultralytics, matplotlib, PIL, opencv-python, and torch.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv8 object detection model from the Ultralytics library. The script loads an image, detects objects using the YOLOv8 model, and visualizes the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

## Dataset
No specific dataset is required. You can use any image for object detection.

## Data Preprocessing
No data preprocessing is needed since the focus is on detecting objects in the provided image.

## Model Building
The model used in this project is the pre-trained YOLOv8 model (yolov8n.pt) provided by Ultralytics.

## Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is not covered in this project. The script is intended to demonstrate object detection and visualization.

## Inference
The inference process involves loading an image, running it through the YOLOv8 model, and extracting the detected objects, their confidence scores, and bounding boxes.

## Saving the Model
Saving the model is not applicable since we are using a pre-trained model provided by Ultralytics.
